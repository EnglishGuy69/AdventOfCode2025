I took two attempts on this one because after I had completed it once I wanted to optimize the solution and created
a second version. I kept the first version to show the evolution.

In the first attempt we create two separate classes that read and store the file differently to answer the questions.

In the second attempt we create a separate structure for the homework question (a set of numbers and an operator),
then we create a common base class and two sub-classes that handle the file loading process differently. In the 
second attempt, the answer is calculated in exactly the same way, but the load process interprets the data in
two distinct ways.
